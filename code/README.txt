Instruction for running this code.

1. Install related Python packages:

The python third-party libraries that I used in this code are:

a. Numpy
b. sklearn
c. scipy

If you do not installed these packages in your computer right now, using follow commands to install them:

pip3 install numpy

pip3 install sklearn

pip3 install scipy


2. Make sure data in the right path.

In my code, I assume that the data directory is in the same level of the graph_partitioning.py, which is the code for my project.

So, please make sure that they are in the right places.


3. Run the code.

a. In command line, using command:

Python3 graph_partitioning.py 

to start runing the code.

b. In Pycharm:

Just click the green run button of this py file.


4. Run different data.
You need to change the filename that set in the bottom of my code.

For example, right now the filename is set to Oregon-1.txt.(in the fourth last line)
Then, if you want to partition data roadNet-CA, just change the filename from Oregon-1.txt to roadNet-CA.txt
And back to step 3, run the code.
